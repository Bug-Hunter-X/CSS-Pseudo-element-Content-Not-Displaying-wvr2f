The following CSS code snippet attempts to style a list item using a pseudo-element and the `::before` pseudo-class. However, the content property is not working as expected: 
```css
li::before {
  content: "\2022"; /* Unicode for bullet */
  color: blue;
}
```
This might seem simple, but the bug arises when the list item already has content, or the element it is applied to doesn't support `::before` pseudo-element. The bullet might not appear or might be hidden.
