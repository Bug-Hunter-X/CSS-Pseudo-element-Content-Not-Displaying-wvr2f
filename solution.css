The solution involves carefully considering the element's existing content and ensuring that the `::before` pseudo-element's styling is correctly applied and not overridden.

Here's a corrected version: 
```css
li::before {
  content: "\2022"; /* Unicode for bullet */
  color: blue;
  display: inline-block; /* Ensure bullet is displayed */
  margin-right: 5px; /* Add spacing between bullet and text */
}
```
This improved CSS ensures that the bullet appears correctly, irrespective of pre-existing content, by explicitly adding display and margin properties.
